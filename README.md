# COMPASS-Framework-Prompt-Demos

**Short Description:** Explore COMPASS Framework principles via prompt engineering. Demos illustrate axiomatic validation & resonance testing to reduce LLM hallucination and boost output coherence. Compatible with Mistral AI (Le Chat), Gemini 2.5 Flash, & ChatGPT 4.0. Practical, reproducible examples complementing the full framework implementation. [Link to main repo]

## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the `COMPASS-Framework-Prompt-Demos` repository! This repository is your practical guide to experiencing the core principles of the groundbreaking **COMPASS Framework** in action, utilizing advanced prompt engineering.

COMPASS aims to increase the reliability and trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) by offering a structural approach to reducing hallucination and fostering output coherence. While the comprehensive COMPASS Framework envisions a deep, code-based implementation for robust systems, this repository focuses on the **conceptual application of these principles directly within LLM conversation interfaces** through carefully crafted prompts.

Dive in and discover how specific instructions and axiomatic guidelines can direct LLMs to self-validate their responses and align them with predefined knowledge fields.

## ✨ What You'll Find Here

In this repository, you will find:

* **Example Prompts:** Carefully designed text prompts that instruct LLMs to perform axiomatic validation and resonance testing according to COMPASS principles.
* **Usage Examples:** Concrete scenarios demonstrating the application of these prompts to illustrate their influence on LLM responses.
* **Expected Behaviors:** Explanations of the type of output to expect when applying COMPASS prompts, and how this contributes to hallucination reduction.

Note:

The actual codebase for the COMPASS implementation is maintained in a separate repository.

This repository is dedicated to scientific documentation, data, prompts, and framework definitions supporting the paper.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To try out these demos yourself, follow these steps:

1.  Select one of the provided prompt texts from the repository (e.g., from the `prompts/` folder).
2.  Open the conversation interface of one of the supported LLMs (see below).
3.  Paste the prompt and initiate the interaction.
4.  Observe the LLM's response and compare it with the COMPASS principles.

Feel free to experiment with the prompts and adapt them to your own questions to explore the effects of COMPASS!

## 🤖 Supported Large Language Models

The prompts provided here have been optimized and can be effectively used with the following LLMs:

* **Mistral AI (Le Chat)**
* **Gemini 2.5 Flash**
* **ChatGPT 4.0**

*Note: Performance may vary depending on LLM version, model updates, and specific input.*

## 🔗 Connection to the Main COMPASS Framework

This repository serves as a practical complement to the broader **COMPASS Framework**. The main framework aims to ensure the structural integrity of AI systems at a deeper, code-based level.
