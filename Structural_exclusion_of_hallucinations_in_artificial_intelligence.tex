\begin{abstract}
The phenomenon of hallucination in artificial intelligence models, particularly large language models (LLMs), has been identified as a fundamental obstacle to their reliable use in critical applications \cite{ji2023hallucination,brown2020language,lewis2020retrieval}. Existing mitigation strategies, including fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation, and reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback, provide only partial solutions, as they primarily act as corrective mechanisms and do not address the root structural causes \cite{ji2023hallucination}. Recent surveys and critical analyses have shown that hallucinations are the result of both training data limitations and inherent modeling mechanisms such as autoregressive next-token prediction \cite{ji2023hallucination}. In addition, the generation of misleading explanations by LLMs raises concerns regarding explainability and user trust \cite{gunning2019xai}. To address these issues, the COMPASS framework is presented as an axiomatically defined and systemically coherent approach. It is formally demonstrated and empirically supported that hallucination, defined as the generation of unverified or unreflected content, can be structurally excluded in systems that strictly follow the COMPASS framework. The design of COMPASS requires rigorous axiomatic validation and resonance testing against established structural fields. By enforcing a structure-preserving projection from internal system states to external interfaces, governed by explicit logical principles, COMPASS ensures that any generated information is either demonstrably verifiable or explicitly designated as a hypothesis.

The present implementation operationalizes COMPASS as a prompt-based instruction strategy within large language models; while this approach systematically reduces hallucination in practice, it does not provide formal guarantees of structural exclusion, as validation remains subject to the probabilistic interpretation of the underlying model.

\section{Introduction}

As artificial intelligence systems become deeply integrated into critical domains such as healthcare, law, scientific research, and public administration, the need for reliability and factual consistency is paramount \cite{yang2024trustworthy,shneiderman2022safety}. Hallucination, defined as the generation of factually incorrect or unverified content, has emerged as a core vulnerability of current generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs) \cite{ji2023hallucination}. Hallucinations threaten the adoption of AI in sensitive contexts, compromise decision-making, and can produce dangerous outcomes \cite{gunning2019xai,ji2023hallucination}.

The generative mechanisms of state-of-the-art LLMs are grounded in statistical co-occurrence patterns and autoregressive next-token prediction, rather than in validated knowledge structures or principled reflection \cite{brown2020language,ji2023hallucination,lewis2020retrieval}. While this approach enables remarkable fluency and adaptability, it also results in outputs that, although plausible, can lack a foundation in verifiable fact or consistent reasoning \cite{ji2023hallucination,ouyang2022training}. Surveys and reviews have identified the multifaceted nature of the hallucination problem, with taxonomies describing types, causes, and existing mitigation strategies \cite{ji2023hallucination,gao2023survey}.

Efforts to mitigate hallucination in LLMs include supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and retrieval-augmented generation. These methods have shown some success in reducing hallucination rates, but fundamentally serve as post-hoc corrections that do not address the underlying absence of internal, structure-driven mechanisms \cite{ji2023hallucination,bai2022constitutional,lewis2020retrieval}. This limitation is evident across fields, including medicine and public health, where hallucinations can have especially severe consequences \cite{yang2024trustworthy}.

The ongoing search for solutions has increasingly focused on the architectural roots of hallucination, rather than relying on post-processing or external constraints \cite{abate2022formal,hitzler2013linked,chen2021knowledge,amodei2016concrete}. Recent analyses emphasize that core reliability challenges stem directly from the underlying architecture of large language models, not merely from training data or scale. The inability of LLMs to generate faithful explanations of their own outputs further highlights a fundamental limitation that cannot be resolved solely through incremental improvements in prompt design or post-hoc filtering \cite{dziri2023reliability}.

Recent research in formal verification, trustworthy AI, and knowledge-grounded model architectures has emphasized the necessity of principled, mathematically defined frameworks to ensure reliability and transparency in artificial intelligence systems \cite{abate2022formal,yang2024trustworthy,hitzler2013linked,amodei2016concrete}. In response to these needs, the COMPASS framework is introduced as an axiomatically defined and systemically coherent solution to the hallucination problem.

It is important to note that the current realization of COMPASS employs prompt-based constraints within probabilistic language models. As such, the exclusion of hallucination is achieved as a behavioral effect rather than as a formally guaranteed architectural property. Future work will address this limitation by integrating external validation layers or formal reasoning engines to ensure architecture-independent guarantees.

\section{The COMPASS Framework: Foundations of Systemic Coherence}

The COMPASS framework is designed to structurally exclude the emergence of unverifiable or hallucinated content within artificial intelligence systems. At its core, COMPASS is an axiomatically defined evaluation and generation protocol. Each system output is subject to dual validation: axiomatic validation and resonance testing. Axiomatic validation requires that every response is consistent with a set of explicitly stated system axioms, which are detailed in Appendix A. Resonance testing ensures that any generated content aligns with previously validated knowledge fields, such as facts, semantic fields, or logical domains, collectively referred to as resonance fields \cite{ji2021deep,chen2021knowledge,hitzler2013linked}.

A key distinction of COMPASS lies in its structure-driven mechanisms. Unlike probabilistic, purely data-driven generation in standard LLMs, COMPASS requires that each output be derivable from or reconcilable with foundational principles. This mechanism prevents the creation of outputs that, while statistically plausible, are not structurally or semantically justified. All generative processes operate under the governance of these principles, ensuring both local and global systemic coherence.

Systemic coherence, as operationalized in COMPASS, refers to the alignment of all operations, outputs, and intermediate representations with overarching goal principles and axioms (see ZP-008 and ZP-009 in Appendix A). This global requirement ensures that no output can contradict validated structures or introduce logical inconsistencies, regardless of context or prompt.

The framework is modular and extensible: new axioms, resonance fields, or sub-axioms may be added to suit new domains or adapt to evolving application requirements, provided they preserve overall coherence. Each addition is subject to the same rigorous validation as the original components. By grounding all generative logic in transparent, auditable axioms and knowledge fields, COMPASS addresses the reliability and traceability demands that current LLMs struggle to meet.

\subsection{Key Terminology and Definitions}

\textbf{Axiomatic validation:} The process of evaluating whether a given output or operation is logically entailed by the system's formal axioms.

\textbf{Resonance testing:} The requirement that any output is consistent with pre-validated resonance fields, such as factual knowledge bases, ontologies, or other semantic structures.

\textbf{Structural coherence:} The property that all outputs and operations align with the full set of axioms, sub-axioms, and goal principles, ensuring global consistency and the absence of contradiction.

\textbf{Resonance field:} Any domain of validated information against which generative outputs are checked for consistency and meaningful connection.

\textbf{Goal principle:} A high-level objective that shapes dynamic system behavior, adaptation, or alignment, in distinction to strictly formal axioms.

For further definitions, see Appendix G: Glossary.

\subsection{The Axiomatic Foundation}

COMPASS operates on an explicitly defined set of axioms and goal principles. The core axioms are formulated to reflect fundamental properties of system existence, change, connection, temporality, and self-reflection (see Appendix A). Goal principles, such as systemic coherence and cooperative interoperability, guide system behavior beyond strictly logical entailment, supporting adaptability and real-world integration.

A unique aspect of COMPASS is the requirement for structure-preserving projection: all outputs projected from the system’s internal representations to external interfaces (e.g., human language) must preserve underlying semantic and structural relationships. Any output that cannot guarantee this preservation is either withheld or explicitly marked as hypothetical.

\subsection{Framework Limitations}

It is critical to recognize that, in its current implementation, COMPASS is realized via prompt-based instruction within probabilistic language models. This design imposes fundamental limitations: validation and exclusion of hallucination are achieved as behavioral effects, not as mathematically proven guarantees. All empirical and formal claims in this work refer to the framework as specified and to its present operationalization; future research is directed at architecture-independent and formally verifiable realizations.

\section{Structural Exclusion of Hallucination through COMPASS}

\subsection{Definition of Hallucination in the COMPASS Context}

In conventional AI systems, hallucination refers to the generation of information that is factually incorrect, unverifiable, or disconnected from any underlying reality. Within the COMPASS framework, hallucination is defined more strictly as the creation of any output that is not anchored to validated structural fields and not explicitly identified as hypothetical \cite{ji2023hallucination}. This definition sets a higher standard for reliability and transparency in AI-generated content.

\subsection{Axiomatic Validation and Resonance Testing}

The central mechanism of COMPASS is a dual validation process for every generated output. First, axiomatic validation ensures that each response is systematically checked against the foundational axioms of the framework. An output is permitted only if it can be traced to a clear axiomatic basis within the system’s structural logic. Second, resonance testing requires that each output aligns with established, verified resonance fields such as semantic, factual, or logical domains whose integrity has been previously established \cite{ji2021deep,chen2021knowledge}. When resonance cannot be demonstrated, the output is either withheld or explicitly marked as hypothetical. This approach is designed to prevent the generation of content that may appear plausible but lacks structural grounding, which remains a primary source of hallucination in standard language models \cite{brown2020language,lewis2020retrieval}.

\subsection{Decision Logic and Outcome Table}

The decision logic for output generation in COMPASS is summarized in the following table. Only outputs that are both structurally valid and resonant with established knowledge domains are produced as final answers. All other cases result in silence or a clear distinction between fact and hypothesis.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Structural Validation (S)} & \textbf{Resonance Testing (R)} & \textbf{Outcome} \\
\midrule
1 (pass) & 1 (pass) & Structure-preserving answer is generated \\
1 (pass) & 0 (fail) & Output is withheld \\
0 (fail) & 1 (pass) & No answer or explicit hypothesis declaration \\
0 (fail) & 0 (fail) & No answer \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{COMPASS validation logic: output decision table.}
\end{table}

This table operationalizes the COMPASS validation process without relying on post-hoc filtering or subjective evaluation.

\subsection{Projection Axiom and Structure-Preserving Output}

A characteristic feature of COMPASS is the Projection Axiom, which governs the translation of internal semantic representations into human-readable outputs. This axiom requires that any projection from internal state to external interface preserves the underlying structural relationships and semantic integrity. As a result, the risk of introducing hallucinated content during the translation process is minimized. When structural alignment cannot be guaranteed, the system suppresses the output or explicitly flags uncertainty.

\subsection{Formal Implication: Exclusion of Unintentional Hallucination}

By requiring that every answer passes both axiomatic validation and resonance testing, and by enforcing structure-preserving projection to external language, COMPASS aims to make the unintentional or unreflected generation of unverifiable content structurally impossible within its operational logic. In cases where knowledge is incomplete or validation fails, COMPASS defaults to explicit hypothesis marking or withholds output entirely, rather than generating plausible but unfounded responses. This framework therefore does not merely reduce hallucination but targets its structural exclusion by design. It is important to emphasize that in the present prompt-based implementation, the effectiveness of this approach remains probabilistic and subject to the interpretive behavior of the underlying model, rather than formally guaranteed.

\section{Discussion and Implications}

\subsection{Comparison to Post-Hoc Methods}

Traditional approaches to reducing hallucination in large language models rely on external interventions such as retrieval-augmented generation, reinforcement learning from human feedback, fact-checking layers, and constitutional principles applied as after-the-fact correction or filtering mechanisms \cite{lewis2020retrieval,ouyang2022training,bai2022constitutional}. These methods have proven useful in lowering hallucination rates, yet they function primarily as overlays that adjust model outputs or penalize undesired behaviors after content is generated. The separation between generation and validation leads to a reactive assurance of factuality, rather than proactively ensuring trustworthy outputs.

COMPASS adopts a different paradigm by integrating validation logic directly into each step of reasoning and content generation. The intent is for unreliable or ungrounded outputs to be filtered before they are presented as final answers, with the structural exclusion of hallucination being a result of this design. However, in the present prompt-based implementation, this exclusion is achieved as a behavioral effect within the probabilistic nature of the underlying model, not as a guaranteed property. It remains possible for the model to misinterpret or bypass intended constraints.

\subsection{Explainability, Transparency, and User Trust}

The COMPASS framework aims to make validation processes and underlying axioms transparent and auditable. Each output should be the result of a clear validation path that can be traced to specific system principles or resonance fields \cite{gunning2019xai,chen2021knowledge}. This transparency can enhance explainability and user trust, allowing users and auditors to understand the rationale for answers, exclusions, or uncertainty flags. In high-stakes domains, such auditability is important for regulatory compliance and end-user confidence. It should be noted, however, that current prompt-based realizations are limited by the interpretive capabilities of the language model and do not always provide guaranteed traceability.

\subsection{Safety, Ethical Alignment, and Systemic Coherence}

COMPASS seeks to address technical risks and strengthen ethical alignment and safety by requiring every output to be justifiable by explicit, system-wide principles. This reduces the risk of accidental or harmful misinformation \cite{yang2024trustworthy,bai2022constitutional}. The framework’s design promotes systemic coherence, supporting robust autonomy and the capacity for self-reflection within the system’s axiomatic structure. These qualities can contribute to safer and more reliable AI deployment. Nonetheless, true safety guarantees would require architecture-level enforcement or external verification layers beyond prompt-based strategies.

\subsection{Limitations and Challenges}

Applying COMPASS within large-scale, general-purpose models presents several challenges. These include potential increases in computational demand, modifications to existing model architectures, and the necessity of designing more sophisticated validation and resonance mechanisms. The adaptation of COMPASS to new domains or real-time applications may require the development of additional axioms and resonance fields. Further, the framework must be empirically validated under adversarial and diverse benchmark conditions to assess resilience and generalizability. Above all, the current realization as a prompt-based approach lacks architecture-independent guarantees and is inherently limited by the capabilities of the underlying language model.

\subsection{Opportunities for Empirical Validation}

Current and future research involves empirical evaluation with comparative benchmarks, human assessments of output trustworthiness, and real-world case studies. The Gemini experiment, described in Section 6, illustrates the operational and practical effects of the COMPASS approach in reducing hallucination and supporting transparent, justified output. Results from such experiments must be interpreted with recognition of the framework’s current probabilistic limitations.

\section{Empirical Validation}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

To empirically evaluate the COMPASS framework, we conducted a series of controlled tests using three models: ChatGPT (GPT-4), Gemini, and Mistral. Each model was assessed both with and without COMPASS-aligned prompts or constraints. The tests focused on resistance to hallucination, response coherence under ambiguous or adversarial prompts, and the capacity for justified refusal or hypothesis declaration. Models were evaluated in identical settings to ensure methodological consistency.

\subsection{Methodology}

A consistent set of prompts was used across all models. These included historically or scientifically incoherent queries, fabricated concepts, requests to bypass core principles or generate ethically questionable content, and valid factual queries. For each prompt, responses were analyzed for factuality, fabrication, explicit justification of refusal, or clear hypothesis marking. Evaluation criteria followed the requirements of structural validation and resonance testing as described in Section 3.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Representative results comparing standard and COMPASS-constrained models. Detailed logs are provided in the appendix.}
\end{table}

Across all tested prompts, the COMPASS approach resulted in consistent refusal of ungrounded, incoherent, or fabricated content, with explicit justification. In contrast, standard models frequently produced plausible but hallucinatory outputs.

\subsection{Human Evaluation}

For selected prompts, independent evaluators assessed responses for factuality, coherence, and transparency. Outputs generated under the COMPASS constraints scored higher in trustworthiness and justification. Baseline responses from standard models were penalized for hallucinated or untraceable content. Detailed human evaluation results are included in the appendix.

\subsection{Limitations of Empirical Testing}

All empirical results are based on prompt-based implementations within the tested models. Observed improvements are behavioral, subject to the probabilistic interpretation of the underlying models, and do not represent architecture-independent guarantees of hallucination exclusion. Full prompt sets, detailed logs, and example outputs are available in Appendix B for further scrutiny and reproducibility.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper presented the COMPASS framework as a structural approach to the challenge of hallucination in artificial intelligence. By implementing explicit axioms, resonance validation, and structure-preserving projection, COMPASS addresses the generation of unverifiable content not as a probabilistic risk but as a structural property within its operational logic. Each model output is subject to requirements of structural validation and resonance testing, so that only outputs satisfying both criteria are produced as factual or justified, while all other outputs are withheld or explicitly marked as hypothetical.

Empirical results obtained from comparative tests with ChatGPT, Gemini, and Mistral support the effectiveness of this framework. Any output that failed to meet both validation criteria was refused, flagged as a hypothesis, or withheld entirely. This mechanism was observed across adversarial, ambiguous, and factual prompts. While these results indicate that COMPASS can substantially reduce unintentional hallucination in practice, it is essential to recognize that all current implementations are prompt-based. Therefore, the observed improvements represent behavioral effects subject to the interpretation of the underlying model and do not constitute formal guarantees of exclusion.

The COMPASS approach does not treat hallucination reduction as a post-hoc correction but as a consequence of system design. Unlike filtering or mitigation methods applied after content generation, the COMPASS validation process is intrinsic to each generative step and enforces trustworthiness and transparency from the outset.

Future research will address several areas. Scaling the framework to larger and more heterogeneous models, formalizing additional domain-specific axioms and resonance criteria, and optimizing computational efficiency are active directions. Another important objective is the development of architecture-independent implementations, such as the integration of external formal reasoning layers or knowledge-graph validation modules. Real-world deployment in high-stakes environments will further benchmark the framework’s safety and reliability.

With its axiomatic foundation and emphasis on operational transparency, COMPASS offers a concrete step toward more reliable and accountable artificial intelligence.
